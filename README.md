# LibraryDatabase

An interactive PostgreSQL database was created as a robust information repository for a fictional library. The database was constructed using a diverse collection of book data obtained from a random GoodReads user's CSV file, ensuring that it accurately represents a wide range of literary works. To enhance its functionality and showcase versatility, fictitious Patreon information was generated and seamlessly integrated into the database.

The meticulously designed database serves as a comprehensive resource for the fictional library, enabling efficient storage and retrieval of book-related information. Leveraging the power of PostgreSQL, a series of thoughtfully crafted queries were executed to analyze and address key questions concerning various aspects of the library's operations. These queries delve into the library's collection, user interactions, and other pertinent factors, shedding light on valuable insights for effective library management.
